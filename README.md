# Energy Trading Marketplace

## Project Description

The Energy Trading Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on blockchain technology that enables peer-to-peer trading of renewable energy. This smart contract-based solution allows energy producers (individuals with solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable sources) to directly sell their excess energy to consumers without intermediaries.

The platform facilitates transparent, secure, and efficient energy transactions while promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources. Users can list their available energy with pricing, purchase energy from various sources, and manage their earnings through a fully decentralized system.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize the energy market by creating a decentralized ecosystem where:

- **Energy Independence**: Individuals and communities can become energy self-sufficient by trading renewable energy directly
- **Sustainability**: Promote widespread adoption of clean energy sources through economic incentives
- **Transparency**: All energy transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and traceability
- **Accessibility**: Remove barriers to entry in energy trading, making it accessible to small-scale producers
- **Efficiency**: Eliminate intermediaries and reduce energy trading costs through direct peer-to-peer transactions

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
